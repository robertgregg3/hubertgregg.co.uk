          <i>
             During our stay in Athens there had been a party at which I had sat at the piano and sung some of my songs. They were admired by the producer Betty Box, so when I heard that she needed a song for Brigitte to sing in the film I set to work. Probably because of the warmth of my feeling for Brigitte the whole process took no longer than five minutes. The song had one simple chorus only: Do you love me ? Je ne sais pas, darling, I don't know ? was what it said - which might have been what I was wondering.

              Betty was pleased with the song and accepted it and next day, as I walked into the Pinewood bar at lunch time, Brigitte came running over to me. 'Hubert !' she said, pronouncing it in the French way [which I must confess made it sound better than Rupert], ' La chanson est tout ce qu'il y a de plus mignon. Et toi aussi !' Then she threw her arms round me and gave me a long and beautiful kiss. Not surprisingly this was telegraphed all over the studio but I didn't mind. A good deal of laughter came my way, especially as 'Mr. Archer' as portrayed in the movie was a very unlikely opposite number to Brigitte, though not as unlikely as Dirk Bogarde.
